/*
Tom is selling some handmade items but demand for them has become very popular! 
Hundreds of people are queuing to order the items. Tom requests your help to write a program to 
keep track of people in the queue. Each person has a unique integer ID.

While people usually join the back of the queue, some are treated as VIPs and join the front of the queue. 
Tom also has a membership system in which a member can be slotted into the queue after the first K people 
(or less, if the queue has less than K people). 
Note that VIPs and members do not have their position fixed â€“ 
Subsequent VIPs and/or members can push the positions of existing ones further back.

Your program needs to support the following operations which can be performed in any order:

queue x : person with ID x joins the back of the queue

member x : person with ID x joins the queue, now having (K+1)th position (or less if there were <K people in front)

vip x : person with ID x joins the queue, now having 1st position, pushing all other people in the queue back

slower : K is increased by one, so members join the queue further back

faster : K is decreased by one, so members wait less

findID pos : print the ID of the person at the position pos in the queue, on a new line

It is guaranteed that no one will join the queue more than once, that K will never be less than 1 at all times, 
and that there will be a person at the position queried.

Input
The first line contains 2 integers Q (1 <= Q <=800,000) the number of operations to perform, and 
K (1 <= K <=  900,000) the maximum number of people in front of a member who is about to join the queue.

Each of the next Q lines contains one of the six operations described above. Each ID is a positive integer 
(1 <ID < 10^6)

Output
One line for each findID pos command. Each line contains a person ID.

Operations:

queue x: Add person x to the back of the queue.
member x: Insert person x at position K+1 (or the end if there are fewer than K people).
vip x: Insert person x at the front (position 1).
slower: Increase K, meaning members will join later in the queue.
faster: Decrease K, meaning members will join earlier in the queue.
findID pos: Find and return the person at position pos.

and when we add from the front, must go -> this way
